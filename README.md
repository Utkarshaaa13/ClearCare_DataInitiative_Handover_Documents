Project Overview
The ClearCare Data Initiative aims to provide a user-friendly price transparency tool to compare healthcare costs across hospitals and insurance providers. The initiative focuses on enhancing consumer empowerment by simplifying complex pricing data and offering cost comparisons in an accessible format. As part of the database team, our responsibility is to manage the project's data effectively to ensure its accuracy, integrity, and usability. 

Project Files :
The project consists of the following files and documents:

1. Final Presentation_CLEARCARE DATA.pptx
A PowerPoint presentation summarizing the key insights and progress of the ClearCare Data Initiative.
Includes project objectives, findings, and visualizations related to the cost comparison between hospitals and insurance providers.

2. Final_ClearCare_Initiative_Backup.backup
A backup of the final database that contains all the data for hospitals, treatments, and insurance provider charges.
This file is used for recovery and migration of the database to different environments if needed.

3. MIS 6349.001_Group4_ProjectCharter_Approval.msg
Email communication regarding the approval of the project charter for Group 4's project in the MIS 6349 course.
Contains initial project approval details and the scope of work.

4. MIS6349_Group4_Project_Charter.pdf
The formal project charter document for the ClearCare Data Initiative.
Outlines the project's goals, objectives, methodology, and stakeholders involved.

5. Negotiated_Charges_Table for All Datasets.zip
A ZIP file containing tables with negotiated charges for various insurance providers across multiple datasets.
These tables are critical for the analysis of insurance rate comparisons.

6. PROJECT DESIGN Document-Group 4.docx
A design document detailing the architecture and flow of the ClearCare Data Initiative project.
It outlines the structure of the database, including ER diagrams, schema, and normalization details for handling the healthcare cost data.

7. Procedure_Tables for All Datasets.zip
A ZIP file containing procedure tables for all datasets, outlining the treatment procedures and their corresponding codes.
The procedure tables are essential for mapping the healthcare services to the correct charges and insurance provider rates.

8. Python_code_scripts.ipynb
A Jupyter notebook containing Python code scripts used for data cleaning, transformation, and loading into the PostgreSQL database.
The scripts handle the normalization of the datasets and automate the process of preparing data for analysis and visualization.

Getting Started :
Prerequisites
Python (for data cleaning and processing)
PostgreSQL (for database management)
Jupyter/Google Colab (for running Python code scripts)
PowerPoint (for viewing the final presentation)


Installation and Setup :
Clone or download the repository containing the project files.
Set up PostgreSQL and restore the database from the backup (Final_ClearCare_Initiative_Backup.backup) if needed.
Run the Python scripts (Python_code_scripts.ipynb) in Jupyter or Google Colab to process the data and load it into the PostgreSQL database.
Review the project design document to understand the database schema and data flow.
View the presentation (Final Presentation_CLEARCARE DATA.pptx) to get an overview of the project's progress and findings.

Key Features :
Data Collection & Analysis: The project collects data from multiple hospitals and insurance providers, focusing on healthcare cost transparency and insurance rate comparison.
Insurance Cost Comparison: Users can compare gross and negotiated charges from different insurance providers to make informed decisions.
Data Automation: Python scripts automate the data cleaning, transformation, and database loading, ensuring efficiency and scalability.
